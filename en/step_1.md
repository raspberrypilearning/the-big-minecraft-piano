## What you will make
In this resource you will connect a Python script to a Sonic Pi script to allow communication between the programs. Then you can use your Python skills to construct a large piano in Minecraft, which will play notes when the keys are stepped on.


## What you will learn
By creating a Minecraft piano with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- How to play music in Sonic Pi using Python
- How to use `for` loops and functions to construct a piano keyboard
- How to send notes to Sonic Pi, dependent on your position in Minecraft

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
