## The big minecraft piano

In this project, you're going to create a piano keyboard in Minecraft that can be played when Steve walks over the keys.

This project uses Sonic Pi to play the music, Minecraft to visualise the piano and act as your input, and Python to build the piano and act as a way for Sonic Pi and Minecraft to communicate with each other.

This project cover lots of computer science concepts, such as creating functions, using for loops, and network communication.
