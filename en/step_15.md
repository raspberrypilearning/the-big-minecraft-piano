## What next?

- You could try and increase the size of your piano, by calling the `make_octave` function in a `for` loop. You'll also need to add more values to your `black_notes` and `white_notes`.

- Alter your Sonic Pi script, so that it uses different synths. You can find more at [Getting Started with Sonic Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-sonic-pi/).

- Add a few LEDs into a breadboard, and you can make them light up when the keys are pressed. Or maybe the piano keys could change colour when they are stepped on.

- It's a little difficult to differentiate between the white keys at the moment. Could they be redrawn as a different coloured tile each time they are played?
